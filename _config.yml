about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  When I was an undergraduate, I took semesters off to be a guitarist but had to program for a living.
  However, I realized I enjoy programming and quite good at it so I came back to school.
  Since then I have improved my software and data engineering skills but my passion for music was aroused again 
  so I joined [Music and Audio Computing Lab](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/) dreaming of making <mark>AI DJ</mark>. 
  The first research I wanted to do for AI DJ was making a machine listening system, therefore I’ve worked on end‐to‐end audio classification. 

  I also worked as a resident DJ at a dance club called Vent until before COVID‐19 and still enjoy playing music at events. 
  With the domain knowledge, I work on understanding the creative process of DJing using computational methods and creating AI DJ.

  I've been wondering how people see beauty in music, and somehow, I currently work on building machines that can understand the beauty and assist music for humans.
