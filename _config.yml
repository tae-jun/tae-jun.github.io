about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am an instrument maker.
  
  While traditional makers have used wood, metal, circuits, or rule-based software synthesizers,
  
  I create instruments with AI.

  <br>
  
  Currently, I work on generative music models at Neutune for the MixAudio service.

  <br>
  
  During my PhD, I focused on DJ mix analysis and music structure analysis.

        This paper proposes new architectures for music AI agents that go beyond audio generation, focusing on transparent attribution and interpretability in music creation. The work addresses challenges faced in the post-streaming era and suggests frameworks to improve accountability, fair credit, and transparency in AI-assisted music production.
